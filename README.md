# Survivors Clone

![Godot](https://img.shields.io/badge/engine-godot-blue?logo=godot-engine&logoColor=white)

This is a game development project made with **Godot 4** and **GDScript**, where I'm recreating the core gameplay mechanics of [Vampire Survivors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Survivors).

This project is a learning exercise for me, and I plan to add my custom features and ideas to it eventually.

## Technologies Used

- **Game Engine**: [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
- **Language**: [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html)
