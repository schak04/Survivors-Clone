Thumb Rule: Signal Up, Call Down 
================================

This rule says that it is better to use signals to call a parent script
than it is to call a function of a parent.

Why so?
- Parents may not have the function required.
- This approach provides more control over what is sent to the parent object.
- It is more maintainable.
