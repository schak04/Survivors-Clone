Signals:
========

- A signal is a built-in condition that can trigger a function in another script.
- A node has many unique signals of its own and it also inherits signals from its parent.
- Custom signals can also be made.
- Signal declaration is done using the `signal` keyword.
- Signal invocation is done using the `emit_signal()` function.

To connect a signal to the script:
	Dock -> Node -> Signals -> double-click on the signal -> connect
