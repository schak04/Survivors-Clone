Collision Layers vs Collision Masks in Godot
============================================

Collision Layer:
- The layer(s) an object exists on.
- Other objects will see it only if their mask is set to its layer.

Collision Mask:
- The layer(s) an object scans for collisions.
- This determines which other layers this object will collide with.

Analogy:
- Layer = “Where I live”
- Mask  = “Who I care about bumping into”
